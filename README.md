The Pokédex Database is an text-based application that emulates the Pokédex from the titular game and television series. This database, however, stores the first 4 generations of pokémon—or 494 unique Pokémon—including their name, type, status, base stats and id number. The user may query the database using a Java-powered UI system, and may ask:
- Which Pokémon have been caught/seen?
- Which Pokémon start with the letter ____?
- Which Pokémon include ____ in their name?
- Which Pokémon have the type ____?
- Which Pokémon have the type ____ ____?
- Which Pokémon have the highest overall base stats?
- Which Pokémon have the highest ____ base stat?
- Open pokédex entry for pokémon ID ____.
- Try to catch a pokémon with the ID ____.
- Release a pokémon with the ID ____.

The data for this database was generated from a public excel sheet, in which a program scanned through and automatically filled in the corresponding tables for querying. As part of this project, we also learned about and implemented defensive measures preventing injection attacks.
